# Timeless Brews Landing Page

Welcome to the repository for the "Timeless Brews" landing page! üç∫

This project was developed as a personal initiative to showcase my skills in web development and user experience design. The landing page features a fictional beer called "Timeless Brews," blending tradition with a modern twist.

## Technologies Used

- React: I utilized React for the development of the page, harnessing its power and flexibility.
- Design Inspired by Dribbble: The page's design is based on an incredible creation I found on Dribbble. You can find the design [here](https://dribbble.com/shots/5657029-sapporo-beer?utm_source=Clipboard_Shot&utm_campaign=emrescr&utm_content=sapporo%20beer&utm_medium=Social_Share&utm_source=Clipboard_Shot&utm_campaign=emrescr&utm_content=sapporo%20beer&utm_medium=Social_Share).
